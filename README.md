# Design

This section outlines the design process and choices for the project, focusing on creating an aesthetically pleasing and functional website.

**Initial Concept:** Explore the initial design concept on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/lk5TasgZyj0YGNNZ4hpgdn/Project-4---Restaurant?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=HIdRRCTGi6cB25rD-1). Changes were made to the original design for improved visual appeal and to remove redundant elements.

**Color Palette:** 
- Azure Blue (#007FFF): Used exclusively for the logo to maintain its uniqueness.
- Midnight Blue (#111B2C): Chosen for the background and dropdown menus for optimal contrast and eye comfort.
- Dark Navy Blue (#1C2E4A): Applied to the navbar and footer for a distinct contrast with the main content.
- Black and White: Standard for text, ensuring readability.
- Coral (#FF7F50): Employed for CTA buttons and links to attract attention.

![Color Scheme](./docs/color-scheme.png)

**Typography:**
- Satisfy: Selected for the logo to embody the elegance of a high-end restaurant.
- Lora & Lato: Used for headings and body text, respectively, offering a balance between similarity and contrast for improved readability.

**Design Evolution:** 

- Simplified Navigation: Reduced the number of buttons, focusing on a single versatile button in the hero section. This button dynamically changes based on user status (anonymous or logged in), enhancing user interaction.

- Enhanced Hero Section: Added introductory text to provide context and encourage account creation. Merged opening hours for clarity.

- Accessibility Improvements: Darkened the blue background for better readability by screen readers.

- Menu Layout: Refined the menu layout for a more uniform appearance.

- Streamlined Table Booking: Revamped the table booking process for efficiency and user convenience. Users can now make reservations with minimal input, receiving instant feedback through the platform.

- Account Management: Simplified password recovery process and considering future enhancements like email confirmations.

- Feedback Mechanism: Utilized Django's built-in messaging for user feedback, aligning with the site's aesthetic and functionality.

- Social Media Integration: Customized social media icons to match the siteâ€™s design.

- Optimization: Removed the contact page for a more streamlined user experience.

- Technical Issues: Addressed and temporarily removed the problematic Google image from the footer, planning to resolve the issue later.

# Testing

## HTML
W3C Markup Validation Service, a tool for checking the markup validity of web documents in HTML, was utilized to ensure that the website conforms to web standards.

**Errors in the landing page:** The validator showed the following errors,

![Home Page HTML errors](./docs/html-index-error.JPG)

**Error in the menu page:** The validator showed the following error,

![Menu Page HTML error](./docs/html-menu-error.JPG)

**Restricted Pages:** An error occurred when it tried to analyze the page for users, in the console it wrote *'TypeError: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable'* for the following pages,
- Manage Reservations
- Edit Reservation
- Delete Reservation

![Restricted](./docs/html-restricted.JPG)

I have since added @login_required in their views and thereby fixed the issue.
Once I fixed it, it gave me this info,

![Info](./docs/html-bug-fixed.JPG)

I have searched my entire file and cannot find what it is referring too, I think that it has something to do with django, since it only appeared when I added the @login_required to the viewpoints. I will seek assistance regarding this issue.

**Success:** No other pages showed any issues, and after having solved the minor issues shown in the home page and the menu page we are met by a success message,

![Success](./docs/html-success.JPG)

## CSS
W3C CSS validation was used to validate the CSS of this project. No errors where found.

![Success](./docs/css-success.JPG)

## Python
All Python code is written to the standards of PEP8. It has been double checked using the [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#)

# Features

## Home Page

This button will change to *RESERVE TABLE* once they are logged in for convenience. It also has the restaurants opening hours and informational text.

# Notes

**Media Folder:** This project currently does not use the *media* folder, as it is designed without the need for handling user-uploaded content. The folder is kept in place to allow for easy integration of media files in the future.

## Special Admin Permissions

In the Azure Bistro application, administrators have extended permissions compared to regular users. One key distinction is in the reservation system:

- **Regular Users**: Cannot book a reservation for a date and time that has already been booked by another user. This restriction ensures that double bookings do not occur, maintaining a smooth and efficient reservation process.

- **Administrators**: Have the ability to override this restriction and book reservations even on dates and times that are already booked. This feature is intended to provide flexibility for handling special circumstances or last-minute changes that might require administrative intervention.
